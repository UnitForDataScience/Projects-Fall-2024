This project focuses on developing an advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline leveraging the Consumer Complaint Database to automate and enhance the analysis of consumer financial complaints. The project has three major parts. First, using pretrained LLMs such as BERT and T5 as well as supervised machine learning algorithms, the pipeline will conduct text classification, categorizing complaints into relevant product types and issue categories to identify the most common problems faced by consumers. Second, sentiment analysis will be applied to gauge consumer satisfaction levels, providing insights into the emotional tone of the complaints. By integrating these components, the pipeline will provide a powerful tool for financial institutions, regulatory bodies, and researchers to efficiently process and analyze large volumes of consumer complaints, uncover emerging trends, address systemic issues, and ultimately enhance consumer protection efforts through data-driven insights.
