This project will undertake a comprehensive analysis of how climate change, security, and gender issues has evolved in the international arena, using the United Nations General Debate (UNDG) corpus and leveraging advanced NLP techniques including Transformer-based AI models. First, using supervised machine learning algorithms and word embeddings such as Glove and Word2Vec, the project will conduct similarity analysis to examine how different countries align or diverge in their discourse on these issues, offering insights into the formation of international coalitions, areas of contention, and the shifting dynamics of global politics. Second, the project will apply topic modeling to identify key topics and track their prominence over time in global arena. Third, using Transformer-based models, text summarization will distill complex speeches into concise summaries, highlighting the evolution of arguments, policy proposals, and rhetorical strategies. The project aims to reveal the underlying trends and changes in how climate change, security, and gender issues are framed and addressed in the international arena, providing a data-driven perspective on the factors that influence global politics and policymaking over time.
