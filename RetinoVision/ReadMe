Deep learning and machine learning methods have emerged as pivotal in healthcare, as they advance medical research and fostering data-driven decision-making processes. Specifically, the advent of transformer architecture-based models has brought many advantages for medical diagnosis. This project builds upon our prior work in machine learning and deep learning applications for medical diagnostics, this time focusing on the challenge of detecting diabetic retinopathy. The ability to diagnose this condition accurately and swiftly is crucial for initiating early interventions and delivering effective treatments. Transformer architecture-based deep learning algorithms are particularly promising for improving both the diagnostic accuracy and speed. This project will explore the effectiveness of leading-edge deep learning models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), in classifying diabetic retinopathy. Methodically, the project will conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis of traditional deep learning approaches and the newer transformer-based models in medical diagnosis. The outcomes of this project can potentially offer invaluable insights for both healthcare providers and researchers, leading to the development of more refined diagnostic tools and further innovations in computational methods that continue to transform healthcare. To achieve a thorough assessment of these advanced techniques, the project will employ several large datasets of diabetic retinopathy diagnostics images, essential for the ViT models.
